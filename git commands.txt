echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/nittasreenivas/test.git
git push -u origin main
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/nittasreenivas/test.git

git checkout -b add-new-category : create a new branch and it replaces master in vscode.
